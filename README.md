## Data Visualization - IBM Cognos
  This course covers some of the first steps in the development of data visualizations using spreadsheets and dashboards. I began the process of telling a story with my data by creating the many types of charts that are available in spreadsheets like Excel. I explored the different tools of a spreadsheet, such as the important pivot function and the ability to create dashboards and learn how each one has its own unique property to transform your data. I continued to gain valuable experience by becoming familiar with the popular analytics tool - IBM Cognos Analytics - to create interactive dashboards.
  
## Python for Data Science, AI and Development
  I started my learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general, with this beginner-friendly introduction to Python. Python is one of the worldâ€™s most popular programming languages, and there has never been greater demand for professionals with the ability to apply Python fundamentals to drive business solutions across industries. 
    
## Python Projects for Data Science
  This mini-course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. The completion of this course involves working on a hands-on project where you will develop a simple dashboard using Python.
  
## SQL for Data Science with Python
  Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . I worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I also created a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs, I practiced building and running SQL queries. I also learnt how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

## Data Analysis with Python
  I learnt how to analyze data using Python. This course took me from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. I gained knowledge on how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

  Topics covered:

  1) Importing Datasets
  2) Cleaning the Data
  3) Data frame manipulation
  4) Summarizing the Data
  5) Building machine learning Regression models
  6) Building data pipelines

## Data Visualization with Python
   One of the key skills of a data scientist is the ability to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. Learning how to leverage a software tool to visualize data enabled me to extract information, better understand the data, and make more effective decisions. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course. I used several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
   
## Data Analyst Capstone Project
  In this course, I applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I learnt as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. I completed the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project culminated with a presentation of a data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization.
