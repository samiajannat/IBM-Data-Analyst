## Data Visualization - IBM Cognos
  This course covers some of the first steps in the development of data visualizations using spreadsheets and dashboards. I began the process of telling a story with my data by creating the many types of charts that are available in spreadsheets like Excel. I explored the different tools of a spreadsheet, such as the important pivot function and the ability to create dashboards and learn how each one has its own unique property to transform your data. I continued to gain valuable experience by becoming familiar with the popular analytics tool - IBM Cognos Analytics - to create interactive dashboards.
